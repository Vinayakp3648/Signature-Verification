The process of verifying a digital signature on data with a public key and a digital signature algorithm is known as signature verification. It's a way to confirm someone's identity. Signature verification is used by banks, intelligence agencies, and other esteemed organisations to verify an individual's identity. A common technique used in bank branches and other branch capture is signature comparison. A direct signature or a photograph of a signature is compared to the recorded signature image by the signature verification programme. The authority behind any legal transaction is the signature. As a result, the need for signature verification increases. Handwritten signatures are unique to each individual and cannot be copied. Signature verification is not only a popular area of study in the domains of pattern recognition and image processing, but it is also important for many applications, such as access control, security, and privacy. Signature verification is the technique of confirming someone based just on their handwritten signature.
